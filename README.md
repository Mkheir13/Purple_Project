# what is Purple Project?
purple project is a project where we have to make different games like a platformer or a pong for my school project.
We have many choices like :
- Platformer
- Pong
- Space Invaders
- Snake
- Or a game of your choice


# Game Choice
For myself i choose to make a platformer and a pong game.
I choosed the platformer because i like to make platformer games and i think it's a good game to make.
and i choosed the pong game because i wanted to see if i could make a pong game in less than 1 hour.

# Theme
For the platformer i choosed the theme "Adventure Time" because i like 
the game and i wanted to make a game like it.

For the pong game i choosed the pong theme.

# Difficulty encountered
For the platformer i had a lot of difficulty to make the player collide with the platforms 
and i didn't have a lot of time to make the game because i have another job to do.
